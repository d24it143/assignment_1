I started the assignment with the problem 1 which i about the Task manager.
I add the functionality to add task, Complete task
And also filter tasks by the pending tasks and priority of the tasks.

Add Product: Function to add a new product to the cart.
Calculate Total: Use reduce() to calculate the total cost of all items in the cart.
